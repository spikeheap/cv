- Joining an embattled & overwhelmed ops team, I worked with senior management to identify & resolve toxic behaviours in the team.
- Set a vision for the team to escape their inherited technical debt, reduce infrastructure costs, and work towards reproducible environments managed as code. Rallied the team around a roadmap to modernise legacy infrastructure, which shifted from a cycle of negative reflection to optimistic planning.
- Worked with the delivery manager & stakeholders to agree priorities among competing interests.
- Identified and escalated an imminent risk with certificate renewals, escalating to gain agreement for immediate priorisitation. This kept stakeholders happy even though it caused delays to their deliverables.
- Brokered a contentious agreement on use of AKS between HMPPS & Central Digital, and delivered an AKS cluster rapidly, unblocking a project team and enabling them to go-live.
