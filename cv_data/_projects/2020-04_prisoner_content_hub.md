I joined Prisoner Facing Services while they were struggling with technical debt, velocity and an Drupal CMS which was bringing the team down.

I identified that there deeper problems, 

TODO In my first three months with the team...

To increase cohesion in our technical and product decision making:
- I introduced the concept of writing 1-2 page "pitches" for proposed projects, providing clarity and reasoning to the product owner and enabling potential projects to be weighed up against each other.
- I introduced Architecture Decision Records to document technical (and occasionally product) decision making. I introduced this gradually, initially authoring ADRs myself and sharing them with the team for comments and improvements. I then coached enthusiastic members of the team to author ADRs, and the process is now widely used.

I worked to build team cohesion and promote learning:
- I introduced a hack day to encourage the developers to investigate new tools and approaches, and to learn new thigns. This took a few weeks to build up enthusiasm with the team, and we ran a low-key first event. This went incredibly well, and the demos stoked excitement in the wider team for it to become a regular event.
- I pushed for alignment with MoJ and HMMPS standards and established systems, and promoted re-use of prior art where possible. This prevented our technical stack in HMPPS from fragmenting, and enabled the Prisoner Facing Services team to contribute to the emerging HMPPS and MoJ communities.
- I coached the team to introduce rigor into our Pull Requests, highlighting the value to our "future selves" and leading by example with both PR descriptions and review comments. 

I also contributed at a technical level:
- TODO introduced S3 with presigned links
- introduced tech debt firebreak sprints
- TODO CI/CD
- TODO tests for Drupal
- TODO Sentry
- 

- TODO project/architecture wins (this should probably be at the top of the list)
- TODO CMS reimplementation – unblocked team by sidestepping. Reduced risk of failure, built enthusiasm and route to reduce risk/debt in Drupal, and road to exit CMS in future
- TODO Migration to Cloud Platform
- TODO Prisoner Identity - unblocked project that was stuck after 6 months, turned into 1-week sprint (Azure AD)

TODO DM-related wins
- Pushed devs to comment and transition cards - improved transparency 
- TODO Shifted standup to be more concrete things we’d done and useful
