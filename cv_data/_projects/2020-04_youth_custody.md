TODO: what was the project?

I undertook a structured analysis of the systems and processes in youth custody as the sole "technical" member of a cross-functional team. I surfaced a number of technical and process issues causing the data silos and onerous processes for staff, and proposed a long-term strategy to integrate youth with wider digital prisons services alongside tactical first steps to unlock the core case management system's data with the help of the existing supplier.

- Authored a strategy which aligned with HMPPS and wider government digital strategies, leveraging existing architectural principles & published "best practice", while being approachable and concrete. This strategy was well received by digital team's service owner and the head of Youth Custody Service.
- TODO: helped with desk research
- Worked with a key supplier to understand complexities of legacy system and build proposal for collaboration with them.
- TODO reached out to prison staff, YJB/YCS, NHS and suppliers to gather information and get perspectives.

TODO: so what?
