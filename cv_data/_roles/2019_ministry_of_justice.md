As a hands-on technical architect, I led several small software engineering teams, working with product owners, developers and non-technical stakeholders to define strategy, set priorities, and build alignment.

- I fostered communication between siloed groups in MoJ by contributing talks to Central Digital's community of practice, interviewing candidates for the Cloud Platform infrastructure team, and sharing ideas outside the Prison & Probation Service.

- Within HMPPS I contributed to weekly developer & architecture community of practice events, pushing autonomous teams to align on agreed "best practices" through a shared software development lifecycle and shared components & microservices.

- Assessed projects against the Government Digital Service Standard, coaching teams to make sustainable, reasoned technical choices and work in the open.
